## 🔥 What is a Promise?

A **Promise** in JavaScript represents a result that will be available **in the future**, not immediately.  
Promises are mainly used for **asynchronous operations**,*, such as:

| Operation Type | Example |
|---|---|
| Network/API request | Fetching user data |
| Time-based tasks | setTimeout() |
| File handling | Loading images, reading files |
| I/O operations | Database access |
